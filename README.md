# Obscura

> Who would believe that so small a space could contain the image of all the universe? O mighty process! What talent can avail to penetrate a nature such as these?
> –– Leonardo da Vinci, on [Obscura's namesake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura)

Obscura uses [tools.analyzer](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer) and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com) to run [Datalog](http://docs.datomic.com/query.html) queries over Clojure and ClojureScript codebases. Inspired by [Scape](https://github.com/jonase/scape).
